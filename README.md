# Phishing_Website_Detection
This project encapsulates a comprehensive exploration of diverse machine-learning methods to fortify online security against the ever-increasing threat of phishing.

In our comprehensive analysis across a diverse array of machine learning algorithms applied to a shared dataset, we delved into the performances of <b>XGBoost</b>, <b>LightGBM</b>, <b>GNN</b> (Graph Neural Network), CatBoost, and <b>Naive Bayes</b>. This meticulous examination aimed to discern the strengths, weaknesses, and relative efficacy of each algorithm in addressing the classification task at hand. 

XGBoost and LightGBM, popular gradient boosting frameworks, exhibited robust performances, showcasing high accuracies and F1 scores. Their iterative boosting methodologies and effective handling of complex relationships within the data enabled them to yield strong predictive capabilities. GNN, leveraging graph-based structures and neural networks, demonstrated its proficiency in capturing intricate patterns inherent in relational data, albeit with a nuanced performance affected by graph complexities.


CatBoost, with its unique handling of categorical features, showcased competitive results, underscoring its efficacy in scenarios with mixed data types. Its intrinsic ability to mitigate overfitting and handle categorical variables without encoding proved advantageous. Conversely, Naive Bayes, known for its simplicity and efficiency, showcased a commendable performance, especially in text-based tasks. Its naive assumption of feature independence, though simplistic, exhibited surprising effectiveness.


This analysis scrutinized key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to discern the algorithms' predictive prowess. Each algorithm presented distinctive trade-offs between computational efficiency, handling of specific data types, and model
complexity, contributing to a nuanced understanding of their suitability for different contexts.
